# Pizza Order Builder (Builder Design Pattern)

## Overview

Software design patterns are programming paradigms that describe reusable patterns for common design problems. 
There are 23 main design patterns, one of them is **Builder Pattern** which is a **creational pattern**. 
Builder produces different types and representations of an object using the same construction process.

## Project Description

In this project, I have used the **Builder Pattern** to build an **API (Application Program Interface)** for pizza order (just to demonstrate the builder pattern).

- I have created an interface **`IPizzaBuilder`** which has some default functions. 
- On top of it, using this, a **`PizzaBuilder`** has been created, which will fill in the methods required for the building (or more like baking) of a pizza. 
- A base **Pizza** class has also been used.

## Tests

5 test cases were created, in which I have tested the working of the required task.
